Data Description:
The Current Population Survey (CPS) is used to supplement census information between census years. These data consist of a random sample of 534 persons from the
CPS, with information on wages and other characteristics of the workers, including sex,
number of years of education, years of work experience, occupational status, region of
residence and union membership. We wish to determine whether wages are related to
these characteristics.
